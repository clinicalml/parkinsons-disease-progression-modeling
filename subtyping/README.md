# Parkinson's disease subtyping

We take two approaches to subtyping: k-means and non-negative matrix factorization. For k-means clustering, we use our survival outcomes as the patient features. Our non-negative matrix factorization experiments are built on code from https://github.com/ffaghri1/PD-progression-ML.
