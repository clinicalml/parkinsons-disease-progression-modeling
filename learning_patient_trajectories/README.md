# Learning patient trajectories

We learn trajectories for subtotals of the MDS-UPDRS II + III motor assessment. Specifically, we look at the 4 treatment settings (untreated, levodopa on phase, levodopa off phase, and MAO-B inhibitor only). In `Untreated vs on vs off linear.py`, we use only linear regression, while in `Untreated vs on vs off nonlinear fits + clustering.ipynb`, we also include piecewise linear and quadratic options.
